Rules:
Clearly define header / main / footer;

The "container" for the main header and the footer must be 960px wide (includes 60px of padding on the left and right side);

The "container" for the main must be 660px wide (includes 60px of padding on the left and right side);

The logo image must be 80px in height. Make sure to include an alt text;

"Your Name / DCI Social Profile" is a h1. Also use the same text for the document title;

Make the content of main distance from the top by 60px
Apply a padding of 6px top/bottom for the header
The profile picture is 140px wide and tall (include an alt description);
